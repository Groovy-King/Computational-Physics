Remarks:
-------------------
Part (d):
--------------------
We see that the red curve in the figure 'Fourier Smoothening with ten percent coeffs.png' is smoother 
than the data given in the file 'dow.txt'. This is due to the fact that we have removed higher frequency
terms from the Fourier sum, leading to slower, smoother variation in the red curve, compared to the blue 
one. This is even more evident when we consider the figure 'Fourier Smoothening with two percent coeffs.png',
where red curve is much more slowly varying as compared to the blue data.

Smoothening the Square Waveform:
-------------------------------------
As seen in the image 'Square Waveform Fourier Smoothening.png', the constant region of the given
waveform is no longer constant after the Fourier Smoothening. This is due to the fact that we have 
completely removed the higher frequencies from the Fourier series. Adding a finite combination of
plane waves makes it impossible to achieve a constant function over an interval of non-zero length.
It is easily seen that adding more frequencies tends to lessen the wiggles observed and lead to 
closer approximation to the true function. This argument explains why the Fourier Smoothening is
seen to have wiggles, while the true function is constant over a region.
