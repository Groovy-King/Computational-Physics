Asnwer to part (b):
-------------------
We see that the image obtained after the irfft2 is not perfectly sharp. As explained in the problem,
this arises due to ignoring the terms with very small FFT spectrum of the spread gaussian. So,
if we wish to generate a perfectly sharp image, assuming the only cause of blurring comes from
the gaussian spread, we must have a machine with unimaginably large precision to be able to handle 
the very small numbers that arise in the Gaussian, eg. O( exp(-512**2) ). In practice, this makes it
almost impossible to be able to recreate such a image perfectly. However, we do see that the image we 
obtained using a simple machine with the standard precision levels can itself achieve decent 
sharpness, while ignoring the very small terms mentioned above.
