Output:
-------------------
The most predominant frequency in the piano waveform is: 525.231 Hz
The most predominant frequency in the trumpet waveform is: 1043.847 Hz

Remarks:
-------------------
Based on the above observations, we see that the pitch of a trumpet is higher than that
of a piano, which is what we expect from our everyday experiences.

The note being played on the piano is the C_5, which officially has a frequency of 523.25 Hz. 
We see that our obtained value is in close agreement with this result.

Similarly, the note being played on the trumpet is the C_6 note, which officially has a frequency
of 1046.5 Hz. We see that our obtained value is in close agreement with this result.
