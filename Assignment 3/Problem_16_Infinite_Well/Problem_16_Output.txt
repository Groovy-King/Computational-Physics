Remarks:
---------------
From the calculations using 10x10 Matrix and 100x100 Matrix, we see that the obtained energy levels
are so close, that the 10x10 matrix serves as a very good approximation for our purposes.

In the last part, we have calculated the integral of psi(x)**2 from x = 0 to L, and we see that the 
result is indeed very close to 1. The small deviation from 1 is due to the inherent error in the 
method used to evaluvate the integral (Simpson's method) and can be ignored while drawing our conclusion.
