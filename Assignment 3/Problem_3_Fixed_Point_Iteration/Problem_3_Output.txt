Output:
-------------------
The fixed point iteration algorithm converged in 13 iterations
The root obtained for the case c = 2 is: 0.7968133630966887
The value of the RHS at this point is: 0.7968126311118457

The fixed point iteration algorithm converged in 7 iterations
The root obtained for the case c = 2 is: 0.7968128154576731
The value of the new RHS at this point is: 0.7968122575580577

Remarks:
-------------------
As we clearly see above, the fixed point method with acceleratin converged in 
almost half the number of iterations as compared to the usual algorithm.
