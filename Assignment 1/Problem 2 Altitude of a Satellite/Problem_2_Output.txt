Part b)
-----------------------------------------------

T = 1 day (Geosynchronous Orbit)
-------------------
Output:
-------------------
Please enter the desired Time period: 1
Please enter the unit used in the above input (sec/min/hr/day): day
The satellite would have a time period of 1.0 day at a distance of 35827 km from the Earth's surface.

T = 90 minutes
-------------------
Output:
-------------------
Please enter the desired Time period: 90
Please enter the unit used in the above input (sec/min/hr/day): min
The satellite would have a time period of 90.0 min at a distance of 250.32 km from the Earth's surface.

T = 45 minutes
-------------------
Output:
-------------------
Please enter the desired Time period: 45
Please enter the unit used in the above input (sec/min/hr/day): min
The satellite would have a time period of 45.0 min at a distance of -2210.6 km from the Earth's surface.
Such a satellite is not possible!

-------------------
Remarks:
-------------------
The radius of the Earth is approximately 6378 km. From the above calculations, we see that a satellite that orbits very close
to the Earth's surface has a time period of 90 minutes (ignoring the effects of air drag). However, it is quite clear that it 
is not possible to achieve a time period of 45 minutes around the Earth, as the orbit would have to be smaller than the planet's radius.


Part c)
-----------------------------------------------
Remarks:
-------------------
The reason for this fact is explained in 'Solar and Sidereal days.png', saved in this folder. The output for T = 23.93 days is shown below:

-------------------
Output:
-------------------
Please enter the desired Time period: 23.93
Please enter the unit used in the above input (sec/min/hr/day): hr
The satellite would have a time period of 23.93 hr at a distance of 35745 km from the Earth's surface.

-------------------
Remarks:
-------------------
As we see above, the difference between a solar day and a sidereal day leads to a change of roughly 35827 - 35745 km = 82 km 
for the Geosynchronous orbit.
