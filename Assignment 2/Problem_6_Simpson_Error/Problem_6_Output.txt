Output:
-------------------
The value of the Integral is: 4.400026666666668
The error in the Simpson integral is: 2.666666666666373e-05
The error found by subtraction from true value is: 2.6666666667729544e-05

Remarks:
-------------------
We see that the two values mentioned above are not equal. This is because, the term ch**4 is not 
the full error, but just the leading term of the error. For small values of h, this term can be 
used to approximate the value of error entirely, but as we look closely, we see that the true error
and the value of ch**4 vary slightly, due to the contribution of higher order terms.
