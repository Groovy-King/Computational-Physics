Remarks:
-------------------
In the figure 'Grav Field at various z.png', we have plotted the function 
        f(x, y, z) = z / (x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
As we see in the plots, the peak at the center becomes broader as z increases. However, at z = 0,
the plot appears completely flat, even though there is a very sharp at x = y = 0, which cannot be 
seen. This peak causes the value of the integral to be non-zero, even if the function itself is 
zero everywhere except at x = y = 0. While calculating the integral using the Gaussian Quadrature
method, we essentially miss the "interesting" region of the function for small z, due the extreme
sharpness at these values.

To rectify this issue, we could try increasing the v alue of N along each axis, which could allow 
us to detect sharper and sharper peaks. However, it is very hard to completely remove this error
if we calculate the integral using the method of Gaussian Quadrature.
