Output:
-------------------
The value of the Integral is: 4.426660000000001
The error in the trapezoidal integral is: 0.026633333333333137
The error found by subtraction from true value is: 0.026660000000000572

Remarks:
-------------------
We see that the two valyes mentioned above are not equal. This is because, the term ch**2 is not 
the full error, but just the leading term of the error. For small values of h, this term can be 
used to approximate the value of error entirely, but as we look closely, we see that the true error
and the value of ch**2 vary slightly, due to the contribution of higher order terms.
