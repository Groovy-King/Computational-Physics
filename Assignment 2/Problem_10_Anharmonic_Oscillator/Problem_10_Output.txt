Remarks:
-------------------
As the amplitude increases, the restoring force F = -dV/dx = -4*x**3 increases as a**3,
while the distance travelled per cycle only increases as a. Due to this, the time period is seen
to decrease as the amplitude increases.

Further, near the origin, the restoring is nearly zero, as the first, second and third derivative 
of the potential are zero there. Thus, there is virtually no restoring force pulling the particle
back to the origin in this region. Thus, even if the particle has to travel negligble distance,
the time taken to do so diverges, as there is only a very small acceleration in the region.
