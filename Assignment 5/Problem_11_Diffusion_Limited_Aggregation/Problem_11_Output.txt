In parts (a) and (b), we simulated the aggregation of particles that began at the center of the
lattice. We saw the complete simulation for a 75 x 75 grid, but were unable to execute a full 
simulation of the 101 x 101 grid due to lack of computing power. However, a partial simulation
of this case with 20 particles was performed and the results have been saved in the figure,
'Part (a) Partial Simulation of 101x101 Lattice.png'. From the color scheme employed, we see 
that newer particles tend to stick at closer and closer distances from the initial point, until 
finally they stick as soon as they are dropped on the board.

In part (c), we simulated particles starting at random positions around the center of the lattice.
We see that particles tend to aggregate closely around the center, even when they are dropped 
further and further away from the center of the lattice. The figure, 
'Part (c) Random Initial Points Distribution.png' shows the distribution of the initial points 
of the particles from the simulation.
