This output has been obtained by running the Problem_9.py saved in this folder. 
Any figures that were printed have also been saved in the same folder.

Output:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of dimers in the first simulation (without cooling) is: 936
The number of dimers in the second simulation (with slow cooling) is: 1168
The number of dimers in the third simulation (with fast cooling) is: 1093

Remarks:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As expected, we see that slow cooling leads to larger number of dimers occupying the lattice, 
while faster cooling has slightly lower numbers. However, Any form of cooling leads to an
increase in the number of dimers that occupy the lattice sites.

This is because, in the presence of cooling, dimers that are present on the lattice become 
increasingly less likely to be removed. This leads to an overall increase in the final number of
dimers occupying the lattice.
