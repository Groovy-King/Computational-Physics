Remarks:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Above attached are the results of 6 trials of the Monte Carlo Simulation of the Ising 
Model. We have run the first four trials at T = 1, all of which exhibited near perfect
alignment of ALL domains in the lattice. We see that the spins sometime align upward,
and sometimes downward, depending on the random initial state, and the random choices for
flipping. We expect that both outcomes are equally likely, but several more trials are required 
to establish this fact.

Coming to simulations at higher Temperatures, we see that at T = 2, the system took significantly
longer to achieve alignment of domains. As T increases, beta decreases, and the probability of
flipping to a higher energy state increases. Therefore, the system takes longer to achieve lower
energy states, as they are no longer heavily preferred. At T = 3, the system did not achieve
significant domain alignment even after a million steps. As shown in both figures pertaining to 
run 6, the lattice remains random at the end of the simulation, and no observable alignment is
seen.
