Remarks:
-------------------
The low pass filter is supposed to only allow lower frequencies to pass through, while blocking 
out higher frequencies. In our plot, we see that at RC = 1, the output waveform is significantly 
lower in amplitude than V_in, but for the smaller values of RC (at RC = 0.01), the waveform is 
almost identical to V_in.

This plot shows that we can change how "strict" our low-pass filter is, by just varying the 
product of resistance and capacitance used in the circuit.
