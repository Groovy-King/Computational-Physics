Remarks:
-------------------
The plots clearly show a periodic behaviour in the populations of the rabbits and foxes. However,
we note the following interesting features:

    - The maximum number of rabbits is always much higher than the maximum number of foxes. The 
      reason for this behaviour can be explained from the system of equations. Since beta = gamma,
      the rabbits die at the same rate that foxes reproduce. However, from the given values of
      alpha and delta, we see that foxes die twice as quickly as the rabbits reproduce. Hence,
      the maximum number of foxes is always lower than the maximum number of rabbits.   

    - The plots of rabbit and fox populations are clearly seen to be out of phase with each other.
      This is explained as follows. When the number of rabbits reaches a maxima, the foxes have 
      plenty of food, and hence reproduce rapidly. In a short while, this leads to a significant 
      reduction in the rabbit population, and boom in the fox population. However, as the fox 
      population reaches a maxima, the number of rabbits is at an all time low, and the foxes do not
      get enough food to survive or reproduce. In a short while, this leads to a reduction in fox 
      population, as they die of old age. With the threat of predators gone, the rabbit population
      can once again reproduce quickly and reaches the next maxima. Thus, the cycle repeats.
