Remarks:
-------------------
In the figure 'Part (c) Trajectories of different masses.png', we have plotted the trajectories of
spherical cannon balls with different masses, but at constant radius. We see that heavier masses
land further away from the origin as compared to lighter ones. Further, the trajectories all end
at the same time 2.5*v0*sin(theta)/g. So, not only do the heavier cannon balls have greater range,
they also have fallen a greater vertical distance in the same time.

These interesting observations can be explained directly from the equations obtained in part (a).
The acceleration due to drag force was obtained to be inversely proportional to the mass of the 
cannon ball. Hence, lighter masses feel a stronger effect due the drag force, as compared to the
heavier ones.
